# Harvard Final Project

## Video Demo:  <https://your-video-url-here.com>

### Description

This project, **Alien Invasion**, is a Python-based interactive arcade-style game inspired by classic space shooter games after reading Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. Developed as the final submission for the Harvard course, the game challenges players to defend their spaceship from waves of alien invaders while achieving the highest score possible.

#### Key Features

- **Engaging Gameplay**: Players control a spaceship to shoot down incoming aliens while avoiding collisions and preventing aliens from reaching the bottom of the screen.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The game becomes progressively harder as players advance, with faster alien movements and more challenging waves.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the player's current score, level, and high score, encouraging replayability and competition.
- **Customizable Settings**: Includes adjustable game settings such as screen resolution, ship speed, bullet limits, and alien fleet behavior.
- **Polished Visuals**: Features custom graphics for the spaceship and aliens, creating an immersive experience.
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth keyboard-based controls for moving the spaceship and firing bullets.

#### Technical Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is structured using classes to manage different components, such as the ship, bullets, aliens, and game settings.
- **Collision Detection**: Implements efficient collision detection between bullets and aliens, as well as between the ship and aliens.
- **Game State Management**: Tracks game states (active/inactive) and player statistics using dedicated classes.
- **Pygame Library**: Utilizes the Pygame library for rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing game loops.
- **Modular Codebase**: The project is divided into multiple modules for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.

#### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the `project.py` file to launch the game.
2. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship left or right.
   - Press the spacebar to fire bullets at the aliens.
3. **Objective**: Destroy all aliens in the fleet while avoiding collisions and preventing aliens from reaching the bottom of the screen.
4. **Progression**: Advance through levels by clearing all aliens, with each level introducing faster and more challenging alien waves.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the player runs out of ships.

This project demonstrates the practical application of programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handling, and game development. For a detailed walkthrough of the gameplay and implementation, please watch the video demo linked above.
